# Interactive-Quiz-Game-Test-Your-Knowledge-in-Math-Science-and-Physics
This project involved developing an interactive quiz game using Python, designed to challenge users' knowledge in various subjects, including Math, Science, and Physics. The game features multiple-choice questions, real-time feedback, and a scoring system, making it both educational and entertaining.

Description:
This Python-based quiz game is designed to test your knowledge across three different subjects: Math, Science, and Physics. The game features multiple-choice questions, immediate feedback, and a scoring system to help users gauge their understanding of each topic.

Features:
Three Quiz Sections: Users can choose between Math, Science, or Physics.
Multiple-Choice Questions: Each section contains four questions with multiple-choice answers.
Real-Time Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback on their answers after each question.
Scoring System: The game tracks the user's score and provides a final result at the end of the quiz.

***How to Run:
Requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your computer.

Running the Game:

Download the QUIZ_GAME.txt file and rename it to quiz_game.py (or any name of your choice).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where quiz_game.py is located.
Run the script using the command:
python quiz_game.py
Other options to run is to use any programs of your choice such as Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Notebook, etc

Playing the Game:

Upon starting the game, you'll be greeted with a welcome message.
You will be prompted to enter your name.
Next, you'll choose one of the three quiz sections: Math, Science, or Physics.
Answer each question by typing the letter corresponding to your chosen answer (A, B, C, or D).
The game will provide feedback after each question and display your final score at the end.

***Code Structure:

**Main Functions:
math(): Handles the Math section of the quiz.
science(): Handles the Science section of the quiz.
physics(): Handles the Physics section of the quiz.

User Interaction:
The game uses simple text-based prompts for user input and displays questions and results in the console.
Customization:

**Adding Questions:
To add more questions, modify the respective subject function (math(), science(), or physics()) by adding more print statements for the questions and choices.
Adjust the scoring logic to account for additional questions.

License:
This project is open-source and free to use. You can modify and distribute the code as needed.
